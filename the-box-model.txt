Now that I know the most basic concepts of HTML and CSS,
I need to expand upon my CSS knowledge by mastering 
positioning and layout.

Changing fonts and colors is a crucial skill, but being 
able to put things exactly where you want them on a 
webpage is even more crucial.

In this lesson I will learn about:
    - The box model
    - How to make sure elements are just the right size
    with 'margin', 'padding', and 'borders'

THE BOX MODEL:
    The first important concept that you need to understand 
    to be successful in CSS is the box model. It isn’t 
    complicated, but skipping over it now will cause you much 
    frustration down the line.

    Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. 
    These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit 
    alongside one another. You can get a rough idea of how 
    this works by sticking a border on every item on the 
    page like this:

    /*CSS code*/
        
        * {
            border: 2px solid red;
        }

    /*CSS code*/

    'padding' - increases the space 
    between the border of a box and the content of the box.

    'margin' - increases the space between the borders of 
    a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.

    'border' - adds space (even if it’s only a pixel or two) 
    between the margin and the padding.
